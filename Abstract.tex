	\hspace{-1.5em}This document discusses two areas of FPGA development for the LHCb VELO upgrade scedualed to coinside with LHC Long Shutdown 2 in 2019. 
	\\ \\
	The analaysis for three scrambling algorithums, required for data transfer from the front end elctronics to the Data Aquisition FPGA, was compaired against the threoretical form of scrambled data.
	This was found that the currently implimented VeloPix scrambler is the optimum of the choices but also that an alternative multiplicative scrambler was suitable for computer simulations.
	\\ \\
	Current development of an Event Isolations Flaging system is discussed.
	This system is intended to identify and flag the easier to re-construct events in order to reduce event pill-up in the computer network.
	While a bug is identified in the simulated data, the VHDL developent has coninued and is ongoing.
