\section{Future Development}

	Once the current area's of FPGA development discussed in this document are complete, focus can be directed on areas of the LLI still in active developemt.
	One such area is in the processing of incomming data from the optical links into frames in the DAQ, currently being worked on a colleague in Manchester University.
	However, due to the nature of the development being spead over many european countries, predicting the next step in development is a meaningless.
	\par
	Once the FPGA development is complete and the VELO upgrade is implemented in 2019, the more accurate VELO data will allow for greater statistical analysis and more significant results.
	This is of particular interest for rare processes, such as CP violation, which are largely statistically dominated with the current LCHb data.
